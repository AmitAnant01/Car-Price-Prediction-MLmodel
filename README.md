## Created Car Price Prediction ML App!

This project is all about building a machine learning model that can predict the resale price of a car based on its features. I have e not only trained the model but also built a complete web app using Streamlit so anyone can interact with it easily.

## Key Highlights of the Project:

- Cleaned and prepared real-world car data for training

- Applied regression techniques to predict price

- Built a user-friendly web interface for live predictions

- Packed everything into a GitHub repo for open access

## Inside this the GitHub Repo you can find:

- Full ML pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook

- app.py : Streamlit code for the web app

- model.pkl :Trained machine learning model

- requirements.txt : All dependencies which are required 


## Tech Stack Used:

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

- Streamlit

- Jupyter Notebook

- GitHub


## Skills Gained and Applied:

- Data preprocessing and visualization

- Feature engineering

- Regression modeling  and evaluation

- Building and deploying a web app
